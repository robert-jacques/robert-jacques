# Hi, I'm Robert 😃
## I'm a *Data Science* student at the University of Sheffield

I'm an Optometrist by trade, but I'm embarking upon a new, exciting career and am currently studying ***MSc Data Science***.
<br>
<br>
After 18 years, I was ready for a new challenge, so here I am! 🎓
<br>
<br>
- 🖥️ I’m currently working on projects in Data Science, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis and Data & Society
- 🌼 I’m currently learning about EVERYTHING! It's all been new to me, but it's exhilarating and I'm getting there!
- 👀 Ask me about my previous career! From Optometrist → Data Scientist! 
- ⚡ Beyond the world of Data Science, I love watching sports ⚽ 🏉, listening to music 🎵 and enjoying real ale and craft beer! 🍺
