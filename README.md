# Hi, I'm Robert 😃
## I'm a *Data Science* student at the University of Sheffield

A practising Optometrist for the previous 18 years, I'm now embarking upon a new career and am currently studying ***MSc Data Science***.
<br>
<br>

Not one to rest on my laurels, I was ready for a change of direction, so here I am, studying again! 🎓
<br>
<br>

- 🌼 I’m currently learning about **EVERYTHING**. There's so much to take in, but it's been an exhilarating challenge so far,
- 🖥️ I’m currently working on projects in Data Science, Data Visualisation, Data Analysis and Data & Society,
- 👀 Ask me about my previous career... From Optometrist → Data Scientist,
- ⚡ Beyond the world of Data Science, I love watching sports ⚽ 🏉, listening to music 🎵 and enjoying real ale and craft beer! 🍺
